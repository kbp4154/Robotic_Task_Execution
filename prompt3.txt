Generate a task tree in JSON format for the dish {dish}, outlining the ingredients {ingredients}, along with 
input nodes(label(string), state(list), ingredients(list), container(string)), motion node(it is a string), output node(its format is same as input node)
sample of task tree generation of cooking meals:
[
   {
      "input_nodes":[
         {
            "label": ... ,
            "states":[],
            "ingredients":[],
            "container": ..
         },
         ...
      ],
      "motion_node":"",
      "output_nodes":[
         {
            "label": ... ,
            "states":[],
            "ingredients":[],
            "container": ..
         },
         ...
      ]
   }
]
generate single task trees for each dish and give me only list of json task trees with no additional texts or brackets
states can  be empty if they are not relevant to the task. Ingredients is an array of strings representing the names of the ingredients required by this
